# Plots

Two different pieces of software were used: GGPlot and Seaborn.

```/GGPlot/``` contains R scripts for the JMH benchmarks.

```/Seaborn/``` contains Python scripts for the Footprint and the JMH benchmark. 

The plotting scripts in ```/Seaborn/JMH/``` are not used in this thesis, because modelling the error bars isnt customizible with them. Instead the GGPlot ones are used.
